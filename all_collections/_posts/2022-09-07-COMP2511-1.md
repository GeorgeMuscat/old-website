Coming into COMP2511, I have some limited experience with classes and self-taught OOP. So, from this course I wish to build a more solid foundation of OOP practices and techniques. I specifically would like to develop my ability to design and implement solutions to problems that requires more work than just simply following a spec. I am also looking forward to writing more blog posts as my abilities develop… reflecting on dumb decisions can be helpful…

To do this I plan to attempt as many “Choice Exercises” as possible and add custom features to the programs I create. (the forum implementation looks interesting)

Some of my friends who have taken the course before me have mentioned that the content can be hard to catch up with if you fall behind. It was also a common theme that people had issues with the group project. Hopefully the change to pair assessments will make that more manageable. 

To combat these challenges I have setup what I need (VSCode IDE, JDK, Confluence, etc) for the term ahead of Week 1. I have also completed the Week 1 content early, hoping to have the time to start on Assignment 1 as soon as it is released at the beginning of Week 2. 

P.S: One thing to note about the JDK set up, Oracle trying to get every little piece of my personal information is quite annoying, OpenJDK seems to be a better option so far.
